# Graphical User Interface for automating data collection

The GUI is executable python script, with an attached configuration file.

All help is available in the GUI by using the 'Help' button. Furthermore, certain tabs will produce a tooltip when hovered over. This tooltip is a useful help text summary.

It consists of several 'pages' where each page performs a certain function.
This allows each page to have settings relevant to it, to make it easier for users to see what settings they need to change for a specific progress.
