# Graphical User Interface for automating data collection

The GUI is a command-line executable python script. 
From the command line the following settings can be configured:
  * Initial (survey) image size from 128x128 up to 4096x4096.
  * Grid square colour for viewing the overlap on selected clusters.
  * Marker colour for viewing current scan position.

It consists of several 'pages' where each page performs a certain function.
This allows each page to have settings relevant to it, to make it easier for users to see what settings they need to change for a specific progress.
