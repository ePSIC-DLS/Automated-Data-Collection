(It may not be displayed in Ipython)\n* If import fails, it displays * Not Ready Communication * as a print statement. (It may not be displayed in Ipython)\n\n#### Get magnification information\nAs an example using the TEM3 package, we will show you how to get the magnification of the TEM unit.\n\n```python\n>>> eos = TEM3.EOS3()\n>>> eos.GetTemStemMode()\n```\nIn the first line of the above CommandLine, an instance of a class that controls EOS of TEM3 is created.  \nThe second line gets the current magnification.\n"

After acquiring the PyJEM folder path, paste it on the red frame below.\n\n![](image/spyder_UI_folder_select.png)\n\n4. Click [sample] in the red frame.\n\n![](image/spyder_UI_samplepath.png)\n\n5. Click to display the sample file, so double click on the file you want to execute.\n\n6.
