   "source": "## Summary\n***\n  In recent years, there is an increasing demand to automatically control from \nTEM control to acquisition of images, and to control the TEM remotely. \nUntil now, it was necessary to organize programs using TEM external control \n(TEMExt) written in C ++, but there are problems such as the high level of \nhurdling to create programs in C ++ language and few functions available in TEMExt had.  \n PyJEM solved these problems. Since PyJEM is a python library, \nwe can interactively control TEM. \nIn addition, functions available from existing TEMExt are powered up, enabling remote control.\n"

When you execute the script code including PyJEM, \nprocessing is thrown to TEM main unit via TEMCenter.\n\n![](image/pyjem_rest.png)\n\n### TEMPC\nThe figure below shows the communication model when PyJEM is on the TEMPC. Since the communication is between the same, the IP address will be 127.0.0.1. \n\n![](image/PyJEM_in_TEMPC.png)\n\n### RemotePC\nIt is a model that builds a PyJEM environment on a PC other than TEMPC and controls TEM. \nIt is possible to write python script code with NotePC (etc.) and execute it with Remote. \nWhen executing from a remote place, work such as having the TEM connected to the in-house LAN etc. may be necessary.\n\n![TEMPC](image/PyJEM_in_OtherPC.png)\n"
